# syncing - VSCode Extension

**"syncing"** is a VSCode extension, proposed to sync VSCode's settings (**including extensions**) to GitHub Gist.


## Features

**In order to keep this extension as simple as possible, there will be no other features, just these two:**

1. **Upload** VSCode settings and extensions to Gist (auto create new Gist for the first time).
2. **Download** VSCode settings and extensions from Gist.


## Extension Commands

**Type `>Syncing` in VSCode Command Palette to:**

* `Syncing: Upload Settings`
* `Syncing: Download Settings`
* `Syncing: Open Syncing Settings`


## Extension Keybindings

The keybindings are **disabled by default**, but you can enable them by updating VSCode's `Keyboard Shortcuts`:

```javascript
{
    "key": "",
    "command": "syncing.uploadSettings"
},
{
    "key": "",
    "command": "syncing.downloadSettings"
},
{
    "key": "",
    "command": "syncing.openSettings"
}
```

## Extension Proxy Settings

You can add a proxy to accelerate the synchronization, just set in VSCode `User Settings` like:

```javascript
// Syncing Configuration
"syncing.proxy" = "http://127.0.0.1:1080"
```
